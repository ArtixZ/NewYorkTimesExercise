# New York Times Exercise

Built this exercise project from the scratch, utilizing framworks as less as possible.


### Getting Started

npm install;

npm start;

Home page is displayed by default.

Search: Click the search bar, and press Enter.

#### Packages utilzed

redux-thunk
react-router
react-redux

I'm not using any CSS framworks like bootstrap. So a bunch of work is done on layouting.

I'm using flex to layout.

##### Todos

If i get a chance to refactor this, I will categorise CSS and rewrite it with SASS.
